4) Open - implemented to open webpage in chrome as soon as program starts.
5) Google Maps API - implemented to display googlemap and show route between airports.

Description:
Web Application that finds distance between any two airports in the United States.
Airports are in JSON file airports.JSON, which was found using google.
Input of JSON file reads as following:
[3315, "9DD86D78-6910-47A7-BA9F-7C48ADE1C00D", 3315, 1370028886, "717674", 1370028886, "717674", "{\n}", "3413", "Cape Lisburne Lrrs", "Cape Lisburne", "United States", "LUR", "PALU", "68.875133", "-166.110022", "12", "-9", "A" ]
The only data we use is Name, City, IATA code, Longitude and Latitude coordinates.

Input textbox fields only allow airports that are in airports.JSON and will not allow user to put in different name.
Calculate button is disabled until two valid airports are entered, this does allow as well for the same airport.

Warning: If input is the same airport the map may appear gray, but is actually zoomed into the max.

Tested in Microsoft Edge, FireFox, Chrome and mobile devices.
